# React Essentials Boilerplate

  

This project is a simple React boilerplate to easily and quickly start on a new React project.

  

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

  

## What comes with this Boilerplate?

  

The React Essentials Boilerplate features a few of the most common and necessary libs to create a modern and expandable React App:

  

### [React](https://reactjs.org/)

  

	Create great apps with React.js.

  
### [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

  

	Use Typescript to streamline, build, validate and better document your code.

  
### [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/)

  

	Material-UI provides powerful responsive Material Design components to work with in React and create beautiful and customizable themes for your app.

  

### [React-Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

  

	Create great Single Page Applications with React-Router.

  

### [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)

  

	Manage your React App's State and make component communication easy with Redux.

  

### [Thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk)

  

	Extend Redux by adding the Thunk middleware, providing better control over sync or async Actions.

  

### [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

  

	Create unit tests and future-proof your App with Jest.

  

## Motivation

  

This boilerplate was created mainly to streamline the start process of my own React projects, as i realized that i commonly use these libs and follow this same project architecture. Hopefully, this will also be useful to you!

  

## How to use

  

First, make sure you've got the latest stable releases for Node.js and NPM.

shallow clone this project:

 `git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate.git <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`
 
Move into the cloned repository:

 `cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>`.

  

Create your own repo with these commands:
```
rm -rf .git

git init

git add .

git commit -m "Initial commit"

git remote add origin <YOUR_REPO_ADDRESS>

git push origin master
```

Done! Now you can start coding and freely modify the boilerplate.

  
## Useful commands(provided by create-react-app)

### `npm start`

  

Runs the app in the development mode.<br  />

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

  

The page will reload if you make edits.<br  />

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

  

### `npm test`

  

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br  />

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

  

### `npm run build`

  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br  />

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

  

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br  />

Your app is ready to be deployed!

  

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

  

### `npm run eject`

  

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

  

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

  

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

  

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
